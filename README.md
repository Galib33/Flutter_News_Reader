Welcome to "Flutter News Reader".

This project is basically to follow news related to technology.

First of all,thank you for giving me this opportunity. 

I made the design part of the project inspired by the designs in the links below:

The part that I had difficulty in designing was coding the part where the picture and the container with other details meet on the details page. And I solved it with the help of stack. I don't remember having much difficulty in the design part.


I chose to use Hive from local databases for discovery. I pulled the data from the APIs with Dio. I could have used the http package as an alternative. As State Management, I used the BLoC library. As in my other projects, I tried to write as clean code as possible while working on this project.

I hope you will like it. Thank you.
